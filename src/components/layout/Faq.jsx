      a: "One Temp Mail is a free temporary email service that lets you instantly generate a disposable email address to receive emails online without exposing your real inbox. It's perfect for testing, sign-ups, one-time verification codes, and protecting your privacy. People also search for one time email, one-time email, one time mail, and one temp mail.",
    },
    {
      q: "How does a temporary email address work?",
      a: "Click generate to create a unique temp mail address. Use it anywhere you need an email. Incoming messages appear in your inbox panel in real time—no registration required. You can discard the address when you're done.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is One Temp Mail secure and private?",
      a: "We never ask you to sign up to use a disposable email. Temporary emails reduce spam to your primary inbox and help keep your personal identity private. Do not use for sensitive data or account recovery—disposable mailboxes are intended for short-term use.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long are emails stored?",
      a: "Temporary inboxes are short-lived. Emails are retained only for a limited period suitable for testing and quick verifications. For long-term storage, use a permanent email provider.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I receive attachments and verification codes?",
      a: "Yes, you can receive standard messages including common verification codes (OTP). Large or executable attachments may be blocked for safety.",
    },
    {
      q: "What are the benefits of disposable email vs. regular email?",
      a: "Disposable email protects your privacy, reduces spam, and keeps marketing lists away from your primary address. It's ideal for short-term needs like trials, downloads, beta testing, and one-time sign-ups.",
    },
    {
      q: "Is One Temp Mail free?",
      a: "Yes—generating and using temporary email addresses is free.",

    },
    {
      q: "Do you support GDPR and data protection best practices?",
      a: "We follow privacy-first principles. Avoid using disposable addresses for sensitive personal information. Data is purged automatically on a rolling basis.",
    },
    {
      q: "Who should use One Temp Mail? (Developers, Testers, Privacy-focused users)",
      a: "Developers and QA can quickly test email flows. Privacy-focused users can avoid spam when registering on websites, downloading resources, or accessing gated content.",
